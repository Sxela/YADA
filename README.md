# YADA
Yet Another Diffusion Automation

YADA v0.1.0 by [me](https://github.com/Sxela) 
A minimal colab with support for init images, clip and lpips losses.

While we're all waiting for stable diffusion weights to go public, it's also fun to try running ye olde faithful latent diffusion model with the same settings and modes to get ready for day 1 :D

This is a fun project, don't take it seriously. Best, [Alex](https://twitter.com/devdef).

As usual, kudos to [Katherine Crowson](https://github.com/crowsonkb) for sticking all the fancy samplers in one [place](https://github.com/crowsonkb/k-diffusion)
and to [DamascusGit](https://github.com/DamascusGit) for pointers and the idea, and all the guys involved in making [Stable Diffsuion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion) happen
